This repository demonstrates common and uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI, focusing on configuration and dependency problems.  The `bug.js` file showcases examples of problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides corrected versions and explanations.  These examples cover issues within `package.json`, `eas.json`, and related files that can lead to unexpected behavior during development and building.  The goal is to aid developers in identifying and resolving such errors more efficiently.
