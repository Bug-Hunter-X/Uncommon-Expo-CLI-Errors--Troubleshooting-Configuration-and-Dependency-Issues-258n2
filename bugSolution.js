To resolve these uncommon Expo CLI errors, systematically check the following:

1. **Verify `package.json`:** Ensure all Expo-related dependencies are correctly specified and their versions are compatible.  Use `expo upgrade` to update dependencies and resolve version conflicts.

2. **Examine `eas.json` and `app.json`:** Carefully review these files for typos, incorrect paths, and mismatched SDK versions. Ensure the specified build configuration aligns with your project's requirements.  Refer to the Expo documentation for the correct structure and values.

3. **Check for Missing Native Modules:** If you are working with native modules, make sure they are properly linked and configured within your project. Expo's documentation on native modules will be helpful here.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes, cached files can interfere. Try running `expo prebuild` or cleaning your project's build directories to eliminate potential conflicts.

5. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you are using the latest version of the Expo CLI by running `npm update -g expo-cli` or `yarn global upgrade expo-cli`.
