This error typically arises when the Expo CLI is unable to locate or properly interpret the necessary configuration files or dependencies within your project.  This can manifest in several ways, often related to mismatched versions of Expo modules, missing native modules, or incorrect project setup. For example, if you have a package.json file with incorrect dependencies or missing dependencies related to Expo modules. 

```javascript
//Example of a package.json with incorrect or missing expo dependencies
{
  "name": "my-expo-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^48.0.0",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    //Missing other Expo dependencies or incorrect versions
  }
}
```

Another common cause is issues with the `eas.json` or `app.json` files.  Incorrect configurations in these files can prevent the Expo CLI from functioning correctly. For instance, an incorrect build variant, mismatched SDK version, or typos in paths can lead to errors.  

```json
//Example of an eas.json with a build error
{
  "build": {
    "ios": {
      "development": {
        "platform": "ios",
        "sdkVersion": "48.0.0", // Incorrect or mismatched version
        "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp" //Possible typo here
      }
    }
  }
}
```
